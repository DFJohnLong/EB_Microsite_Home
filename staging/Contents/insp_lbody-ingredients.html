		<h1>Ingredients</h1>
		<ul class="ingredients">
			<li>Virgin coconut oil, for the pan (optional)</li>
			<li>3/4 cup buckwheat flour</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Earth Balance<sup>&reg;</sup> Creamy Peanut Butter</li>
			<li>3/4 cup grade B maple syrup</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil, softened</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground flaxseeds</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Directions</h1>
		<p>
		1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with coconut oil or line with parchment paper.<br />
		<br />
		2. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients, except the chocolate, and whip until a smooth, soft dough forms. Refrigerate the dough for at least 20 minutes.<br />
		<br />
		3. Roll the chilled dough into balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Press down the cookies with a fork.<br />
		<br />
		4. Bake until the cookies are smooth and round and dark golden brown in color, 9 to 12 minutes. A few minutes after pulling the cookies from the oven, push a small piece of chocolate into the top of the cookie, so it sticks out from the cookie. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes on the baking sheet, then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes more before serving. These are best served warm the same day they are baked. Store any leftovers, covered, on the countertop for 1 to 2 days. For longer storage, place the cookies in sealed containers or baggies and store in the freezer. Rewarm the frozen cookies in the microwave for 30 seconds, or allow to come to room temperature on a plate on the counter.
